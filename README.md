# Logistic Regression on Breast Cancer Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of **Task 4 of the AI & ML Internship**.  
The goal is to build a **binary classifier using Logistic Regression** on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.  

The notebook covers:
- Data loading & cleaning
- Train/Test split
- Feature standardization
- Logistic Regression training
- Evaluation with confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC curve plotting
- Threshold tuning & sigmoid demonstration

## 📊 Results
- **Confusion Matrix**: shows classification results  
- **Classification Report**: Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- **ROC Curve**: AUC ≈ 0.99 (high performance)  
- **Threshold Tuning**: demonstrates trade-off between Precision & Recall
